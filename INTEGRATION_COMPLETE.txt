💡 TIPS FOR SUCCESS
================================================================================

Playing the Game:
   1. Capture the neutral base (gray diamond) in the center first
   2. Resupply frequently at your green bases
   3. Use terrain - forests slow you but provide cover
   4. Destroy or capture red pillboxes from range
   5. Manage resources - don't run out of ammo!

Modifying the Game:
   1. Read docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md first
   2. All settings are in Config class (src/bolo_engine.py)
   3. Add new features by extending Entity class
   4. Test thoroughly after changes
   5. Update documentation when adding features

Learning from the Code:
   1. Start with lesson/tank_game.py (Phase 1, simple)
   2. Progress to src/bolo_engine.py (Phase 2, advanced)
   3. Study the Entity system pattern
   4. Understand the game loop (input → update → render)
   5. Practice with type hints and docstrings

================================================================================
